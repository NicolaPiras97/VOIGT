#Case study of Raman spectroscopy data using voigt profile

This is the code we used for the case study in the paper "Mixture Representations and Inference for the Voigt
Profile". The code in this version is available for case stydy reproducibility purposes only and it requirea the voigt package for estimation procedure.

##Usage

To run the simulations launch the .R file, which recalls the Raman_spectrum.txt data. Be sure to have installed the voigt package.
