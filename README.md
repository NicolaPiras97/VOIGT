# Case study of Raman spectroscopy data using voigt profile

This is the code we used for the case study in the paper "Mixture Representations and Inference for the Voigt
Profile". The code in this version is available for case stydy reproducibility purposes only and it requirea the voigt package for estimation procedure. The data used are analyzed in the paper: Pisu et al., Innovative method for provenance studies in cultural heritage: A new algorithm based on observables from high-resolution raman spectra of red ochre, Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy 329 (2025) 125581.

## Usage

To run the data application launch the .R file, which recalls the Raman_spectrum.txt data. Be sure to have installed the voigt package.
